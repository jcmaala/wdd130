    <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Jean Clyde Maala but most people call me by my initial JC. I am from Philippines
        and I love everything about computer. I was first introduced in a computer world back when I was in High School
        where I took a Computer Hardware Servicing course and got my certificate for that. I enjoy learning about computers and
        I am so excited to enhance my knowledge about web designing in this course with all of you. Currently, I am pursuing a degree
        in BYU Idaho which is Applied Technology and it's basically about programming particularly Web Designing.
    </p>
    <p>Let us do our best this semester! I can't wait to learn from all of you and from our amazing instructor! I know the Lord will
        bless all of our efforts if we all do our part and have trust in Him.
    </p>
