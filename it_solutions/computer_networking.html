                <h2>Computer Networking</h2>
                <p>If you are running a business that provides outsourcing services, you definitely need to have 
                    a solid computer network that would handle both your internet connection and your local network. 
                    Local computer networks could help your business boost its productivity by giving you less time 
                    for getting other information across the company. Computer networks also provide a connection 
                    between you and your client. This network is called client-server networks. Internet cafes and 
                    libraries are one of the few examples of businesses and establishments that use computer 
                    networking. We at JC IT Solutions provide such services, with our professional colleagues that 
                    will set your personal business networks up in ways you want how your computer networks should 
                    be. We have been able to help other businesses in the past with setting up their own networks 
                    and with the experience of doing it, we are confident that we will do the same for you.
